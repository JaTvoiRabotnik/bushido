I'm at full health, but my opponent already has momentum. This makes me a bit wary. My core principle is survival, so I need to be cautious. While I could try to build balance with "Stay", I feel a potential attack coming. My best bet is to directly protect myself.

My health is down to 2/3, and my opponent has 2 momentum at Sword Range. This is a dangerous position for me, a defensive player. I feel anxious about taking more damage. My priority is to survive and minimize further harm. Retreating while defending seems like the best way to both mitigate an attack and create some much-needed distance from a clearly aggressive opponent.

DECISION: [Retreat, Defend]

My health is still critically low at 1/3, facing an opponent with full health and maximum momentum at Sword Range. My opponent's consistent attacks leave me with only one choice: defend to survive this turn. Any other action would be a fatal mistake.

DECISION: [Defend]
TECHNIQUE: None
REASONING: With my life on the line and the opponent's relentless aggression, defending is the only way to avoid defeat and continue fighting.
