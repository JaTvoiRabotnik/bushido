# Gathering context

You are running inside a large enterprise with a number of internal libraries and systems, and with extensive expectations on the way that you design and implement software.

Use the MCP tool `get_library_context` to gather documentation to help you guide your implementation.  This will return summaries from documentation on relevant libraries and tools.
Times to gather context:
- When terms and identifiers are unfamiliar
- When making architectural and design decisions that merit broader context
- When resolving issues with internal library abstractions

The tool works best when the given prompt is focused and specific.

The tool can be called in parallel.
